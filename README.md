Attract Mode: TeenRoom theme layout

Note: This is visually similar to the OlRoom theme and may share a few of the same graphics, though the code is 100% different. You can find the original OlRoom Theme here: http://forum.attractmode.org/index.php?topic=926.15

This is an AttractMode theme based off of the look and feel of a typical teenagers room from the 80's. It can be used to handle the most common consoles from the time.  

## Features: 
- Has a setting so that it can be scaled, stretched, or cropped to fit 16:9, 4:3 or other visual ratios
- Does not use a spinning wheel (but does use wheel logos)
- Realistically scaled console & controller images 
- Image/Names are based on US console versions
- Works for multiple emulators

I assume that you'll use Hyperspin & Emumovies assets for videosnaps, flyers, etc. Other versions may not fit as well as those. 

I've made a unified layout so you only need one theme folder to handle multiple emulators. 

These theme includes visuals for the following consoles: 

- Atari 2600
- Intellivision
- Nintendo NES
- Nintendo SNES
- Nintendo 64
- Sega Genesis
- Sony Playstation
- ScummVM
- Generic PC
- Generic TV

If you want any other system added to this theme please let me know.

### Usage Instructions: 
There are 2 methods: 

Version 1. Name your romlists exactly the same as the names shown in the console list above, and the theme will change styles automatically based on the display's assigned romlist. (Sorry, Attractmode doesn't tell me what emulator you're trying to use, so all I can do is change the visuals based on romlist name)

b. If you don't want to use specific romlist names, duplicate the layout 
(you can name it whatever you want) and set the "Selected System" option to the specific visual style you want. This is also handy if you'd like to set other layout options differently per-display as well.
